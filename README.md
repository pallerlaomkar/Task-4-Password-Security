## 🔍 Task Breakdown

### 1️⃣ Password Storage
- Studied the difference between hashing and encryption
- Analyzed why hashing is preferred for password storage

### 2️⃣ Hash Identification
- Identified hash types such as MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and bcrypt
- Used hash length and format analysis

### 3️⃣ Hash Generation
- Generated password hashes using Linux commands and online tools

### 4️⃣ Password Cracking
- Performed dictionary attacks using Hashcat and John the Ripper
- Demonstrated how weak passwords can be cracked quickly

### 5️⃣ Attack Types
- Learned the difference between brute force and dictionary attacks
- Analyzed their effectiveness against weak vs strong passwords

### 6️⃣ Authentication Security
- Studied Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Understood its role in preventing unauthorized access

---

## 🛡 Key Learnings
- Weak passwords are highly vulnerable to attacks
- Hashing algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1 are insecure
- Salting and slow hashing algorithms improve security
- MFA significantly enhances account protection

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Use strong, unique passwords with sufficient length
- Implement bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication
- Apply rate limiting and account lockout policies
- Use password managers

---

## 🎯 Final Outcome
This task provided hands-on experience with password security concepts, common attack techniques, and real-world authentication defenses used in cybersecurity.
